"""The paper's own gates have to run, or they rot without saying so.

`audit_claim_words.py` had been exiting non-zero for some time before this file existed: the
survey moved from the appendices into the body, the sentences it keys on moved with it, and
nothing ran the script, so a generated table stayed in the manuscript while the check that
produces it was failing. A gate nobody runs is not a gate.

These are slow enough to be worth naming and fast enough to keep in the default suite. They
need the manuscript and the committed artifacts, not the dataset.
